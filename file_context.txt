Meet the bozo who's got more dogs than most people have friends—four to be exact: Wolfie, Yara, Roxy, and the grizzled Agent Bear, who, let's be honest, probably runs the pack. As an East Coast player, I can tell you that my gaming skills are sharper than a freshly groomed poodle, but don't let the cuddly canines fool you. I started my streaming journey in Fortnite, but somewhere along the way, I stumbled into the charmingly chaotic world of Fallout 76. Now, I'm knee-deep in the Wasteland, swapping caps, trading rare outfits, and trying not to trip over my own inexperience like a Deathclaw on roller skates. I’m still learning the game like a toddler figuring out how to walk—lots of stumbles, a few tantrums, and an overwhelming desire to snack on something I shouldn’t (420-friendly snacks, anyone?). But what's life without a bit of fun? I thrive on hanging out with friends and meeting all kinds of amazing Wastelanders who can teach me more than just how to craft the perfect Nuka-Cola. So if you see me struggling to survive in Appalachia, don’t hesitate to drop by and lend a hand—or just laugh at my misadventures. I promise it’ll be worth it! Oh, and let’s not forget the dad life. Yes, I’m a proud dad, which means I can expertly juggle gaming, parenting, and a whole lot of dog hair all at the same time. If you’re looking for someone who’s willing to try anything once, whether it’s a new game, a wild trade, or just a weird-looking snack, I'm your guy. Join me in my quest for the rarest outfits and the most outrageous stories, where the only thing more entertaining than my gameplay is the unpredictable chaos of life with four dogs and an insatiable urge to explore the virtual world
